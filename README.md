# PetAdoptionPlatform
The Pet Adoption Platform project aims to address the growing need for an online platform that facilitates the adoption of pets. With an increasing number of animals being abandoned or in need of homes, there is a critical need for a solution that connects potential pet adopters with shelters, rescues, and animal welfare organizations.

The project consists of two main components: a backend server and a frontend client. The backend server is responsible for handling data storage, business logic, and API endpoints, while the frontend client provides the user interface for interacting with the application.
